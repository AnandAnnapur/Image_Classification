# Image Classification
 Image classification is an important task in computer vision, as it is used to identify an object that appears in an image. This task consists of labelling input images with a probability for the presence of a particular visual object class, as denoted in Fig. 4. Notably, each image in Fig. 4 has one ground truth label, followed by the top five estimates of their probability of occurrence.
